As a recent Computer Science graduate, I am deeply passionate about tackling challenging problems that demand significant creative thinking. My fascination with complex puzzles has always driven me towards Mathematics, a field where I've spent the last four years conducting research in factorization theory under the esteemed guidance of Dr. Felix Gotti. This journey has not only sharpened my analytical skills but also deepened my appreciation for the elegance and complexity of mathematical structures.

My academic and professional endeavors have led me to become a world finalist in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), a testament to my dedication and problem-solving capabilities. My primary interests lie in Abstract Algebra, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and theoretical computing. These areas, with their rich blend of theory and practical implications, inspire me to continually learn and apply my knowledge in innovative ways.

I pride myself on my proficiency in various programming languages and technologies. Software development, in particular, appeals to me due to its creative process and the collaborative effort it entails. Building solutions from the ground up, troubleshooting, and optimizing not only fulfill my professional aspirations but also fuel my personal growth.

I am eager to explore opportunities where I can contribute to cutting-edge projects in AI, blockchain, or theoretical computing. I am particularly drawn to roles that challenge me to think outside the box and work alongside like-minded individuals passionate about making a tangible impact through technology.
